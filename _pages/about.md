Welcome to the Blog. 

Creating a development [and testing] blog is not an easy task due to technology changes. Everything keep changing so fast, so whatever is "good" today it may not be longer "good" in a couple of months. On the other side, it's been long time since I have wanted to create this blog and I just have been deferring it.  

What you will find here? Mainly, web apps and services with .NET and C#. That's my area of expertise and I really love it.  


I hope you enjoy the material and happy coding and testing.
